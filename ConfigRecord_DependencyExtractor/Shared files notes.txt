p400\meta_hal\interface\sys_time_defines.h
	Included by p400\service\dsp\dspTypes.h
	Defines the GLOBAL_CLOCK_SCHEME enum, where A means old CC, B means new CC, the value is recieved from AOC as power data, read from eeprom
	Suggest remove the enum all together as we only build for new CC (MK II), making this file obsolete.

p400\service\communication\spiDefinition.h
	Mostly defenitions used by either end of the SPI bus
	Unused:
		DAC_TYPE
		EMPTY_TEL_TYPE (maybe reminence from old mco protocol)
	Contains a extern variable decleration, this is not wise in shared header.

p400\service\communication\spiService.h
	False include.
	Note:
		on p400 there is also two versions of this file, the other located in 
			p400/product/mco305/dsp/src/hal/cpu/tiC28/MCO/spiService.h
			
	
p400\service\dsp\dspStatusTypes.h
	Defenitions used in interface of both AOC-MOC and MOC-Option
	Contains some extern variable declerations, that is not wise in shared header.
	
	
p400\service\dsp\dspTypes.h
	??? ./service/lcp/forms/AMARunning.cpp:103:   static U32 maxStep = 23; // AMAZE_STEP_MAX = 23
	unused:
		PWM_PATTERN_TYPE
		TAS_ACTION_TYPE
		POWER_LIMIT_TYPE
		
p400\service\dsp\FieldbusOverSpiDefines.h
	Defenitions shared between AOC and MOC for setting up fieldbus over SPI communication.
	
p400\service\dsp\fifo.c
p400\service\dsp\fifo.h
	Shared util
	note:
		nios_application.bin used the header but not the source, smells like a false include.

p400\service\dsp\serial.c
p400\service\dsp\serial.h
	Shared util
	note:
		nios_application.bin used the header but not the source, smells like a false include.

p400\service\dsp\telegrams.h
	unused:
		AFC_POWERDATA_TELEGRAM_ID_TYPE
		AFC_EXPANDED_TEL_ID_TYPE
		
p400\service\dsp\types1.h
	Heavy canditae for a cleanup
	Break dependencies, and get rid of fragile ifdefs structure, by just utilizing the compiler stdlib i.e. stdint.h
	
p400\service\execution\lock.h
	Error in the config record parser:
		This is included in serial.c, but only when build for AOC, as the build for AOC and Dsp is in the same cr, the current parser gets confused.
		
p400\service\globals\OptionNotificationErrorTypes.h
	Common defines used in status from DSP to AOC
	
p400\service\globals\types.h
	Used only by crc16.c and serial.c (both shared util)
	It is hope, duct tape and shere luck that the typedefs in here is not different from types1.h
	As mentioned before kandidate to a heavy cleanup.
	
p400\service\messagesystem\ModuleNames.h
	Contains an extern variable decleration, this is not wise in shared header.
	Unused:
		noOfStandardCanLocations
		noOfExtendedCanLocations
		noOfCanLocations
		olOptionE0 ( reminence of ABinC option, should be removed )
		olOptionE1 ( reminence of ABinC option, should be removed )
		extern OptionLocation olBroadcast
		OptionTypes
		OptionText
	Limited use:
		from ModuleNames only mnPressureSensor is used.
		from OptionLocation only the following is used:
			olOptionC2
			olOptionA
			olOptionB
			olOptionC0
			olOptionC1
			noLocation
			
p400\service\util\crc16.c
p400\service\util\crc16.h
	Shared util
	unused:
		Crc16()
		crc_16_update()
		Crc16byte
	Used:
		rtu_crc16()
	Note:
		crc.c contain two const tables (arrays) of each 256 bytes (U16), neither is used by rtu_crc16().
		So unless compiler can optimize them away they waste space.
