# Dependency extractor for clearcase™ derived objects
This project was made for a task where I had to extract and visualize the dependencies in our software, based on the config records stored as metadata with ClearCase™ derived objects.

I doubt this is very usefull outside of our internal setup, but feel free to reuse parts of or the complete code. I ask that you please let me know if you use it, just because I am curious.
